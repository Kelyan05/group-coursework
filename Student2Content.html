        This page will delve into the goal in more detail, discussing how we can
        reach these targets and sharing helpful links. As previously addressed,
        this United Nations Goal embodies a global commitment to achieve
        universal health coverage, aiming to ensure that everyone regardless of
        their socioeconomic status or geographical location, has access to
        essential health services without facing financial hardship.

      <h2 id="achieve">How to achieve this target?</h2>
      <p>
        Achieving Goal 3 demands a comprehensive strategy, including investments
        in robust health systems, healthcare worker training, and access to
        medical supplies. Health education campaigns are vital for disease
        prevention and promoting healthy lifestyles. Access to affordable
        healthcare, including maternal and child services, vaccinations, and
        disease treatments, must be prioritized through policies for universal
        coverage. Addressing social determinants like poverty and gender
        inequality is crucial for sustainable health improvements. By
        implementing these measures, global solidarity can be fostered,
        advancing the vision of SDG 3 for universal health and well-being.

      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Sustainable Development
        Goal 3, disrupting healthcare services worldwide and exacerbating health
        inequalities. Health systems faced strain as resources were redirected
        to pandemic response, leading to delays in essential services and
        increased mortality rates. Marginalized communities experienced
        disproportionate impacts, highlighting existing disparities.Progress
        towards SDG 3 targets was hindered as attention and resources shifted to
        pandemic mitigation, underscoring the urgent need for resilient health
        systems and equitable healthcare provision.

      <p>
        By promoting health education, supporting healthcare initiatives, and
        advocating for equitable access to healthcare allows others to become
        more informed about their health. Raising awareness about mental
        health are impactful actions as well as engaging in healthy behaviors and
        supporting policies that prioritize universal health coverage can also
        contribute to this goal.
