    <h1><br />Page Editor<br /><br /></h1>
    <p>
      Name: Manjit Somal <br />
      <br />
      Role : Student 2 <br />
      <br />
      I have worked on creating and editing the following pages: <br/> 
      <br/>
    </p>

    <div class="page-name">
      <h2><br /><a class="page-name" href="home.html">Home</a><br /><br /></h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      <br/> 
      I used HTML as well as CSS in order to create the HTML page as well as to
      positions elements accordingly. <br />
      I created the nav bar and used css positioning to position the elements of
      the nav bar as well as providing padding for the elements to be spaced out
      evenly. <br />
      I created the header for the website which was created with the use of
      CSS, this header shows our website name as well as our logo and goal name.
      <br />
      I was also in charge of creating a global css file which ensured our
      website had a consistent appearance.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    </p>

    <div class="page-name">
      <h2><br /><a class="page-name" href="feedback.html">Feedback</a><br /><br /></h2>
    </div>
