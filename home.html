      <h1>GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING</h1>
      <p>
        This website's mission aligns with the United Nations Sustainable
        Development Goal 3. We hope to raise awareness into the lack of
        healthcare gobally and to ensure healthy lives and promote well being
        for all at all ages. We believe everyone deserves access to quality
        healthcare regardless of background. The United Nations strives to
        create a world where good health is not a privilege but a right.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to end the
        epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases
        by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage, and provide
        access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. To
        overcome these setbacks and address long-standing health care
        shortcomings, increased investment in health systems is needed to
        support countries in their recovery and build resilience against future
        health threats.
      </p>

      <p class="SubHead">How can you help?</p>

      <p>
        By taking charge of your well-being through making informed choices and
        prioritising healthy habits as well as ensuring your loved on are
        up-to-date on vaccinations. Educate others about healthy lifestyles and
        advocate for everyone's right to quality healthcare, especially those
        most in need. The United Nations urges you to demand action, hold your
        government and leaders accountable for their promises to improve access
        to healthcare services for all.
